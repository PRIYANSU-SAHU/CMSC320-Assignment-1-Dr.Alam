Answer: One might consider using Git for a variety of reasons. It enables collaboration among multiple developers/engineers by allowing them to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

Overall, it enhances workflow, ensuring that code development is organized, transparent, and recoverable.
